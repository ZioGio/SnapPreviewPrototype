# SnapPreviewPrototype

On a past contract they asked me to create a prototype for a window snap preview. 

This is a streamlined version of the original prototype with branding removed.

Click the mock browser window's title bar and slowly drag to see a snap preview window as well as an outline of the snapped window.
